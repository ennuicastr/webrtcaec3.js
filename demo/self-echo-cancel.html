        <p>
            NOTE: This is a terrible demo of echo cancellation, and only really
            demonstrates the API. When “Loopback” is checked, this feeds the
            input as output, so will cancel itself and should sound silent. When
            “Loopback” is not checked, it feeds silence as output, so should
            cancel nothing (but is still using the filter).
